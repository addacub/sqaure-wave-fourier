# sqaure-wave-fourier
A Python application that uses Fourier series to produce a square wave, a triangle wave or a sawtooth wave. The user is able to select the wave form, change the number of circles (sine waves) used to approximate the function, the frequency, as well as the colour of the background, axes, circles, vectors and waveform.
